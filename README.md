# Basic Kotlin Blog, Developed in IntelliJ IDEA

This code was developed while following the Kotlin tutorial https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/.

The purpose of following the tutorial was researching the possibility of extending a Java Spring project using Kotlin Spring. Netbeans is the current IDE used with project.

This was my first experience in working with IntelliJ IDEA, developing Kotlin, and Mustache web template system.

The conclusion was that due to the unstablity of the Kotlin plugin for NetBeans (https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-netbeans/issues/122), and additional time required to migrate the rest of the development team to IntelliJ that it was not worth the effort developing a part of the project using Kotlin.
